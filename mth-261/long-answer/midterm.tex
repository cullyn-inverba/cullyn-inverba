  \item Determine whether each statement below is true or false, then explain how you know. Note: that if the statement is false, then it might be easiest to provide a counterexample as justification.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \pts{2} If a linear system has \(n\) variables and \(m\) equations, then the augmented matrix has
    \(n\) columns.

    \basec{\begin{itemize}
      \item \true{True}: creating an augmented matrix can easily be done by dropping the variables temporarily, then \yyy{concatenating the vector of constants} onto the \chap{matrix~of coefficients}, i.e.,
      \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      \begin{bmatrix}[cccc|c]
        \chap{a_{1,1}} & \chap{a_{1,2}} & \chap{\cdots} & \chap{a_{1,n}} & \yyy{b_1}\\
        \chap{a_{2,1}} & \chap{a_{2,2}} & \chap{\cdots} & \chap{a_{2,n}} & \yyy{b_2}\\
        \chap{\vdots} & \chap{\vdots} & \chap{\ddots} & \chap{\vdots} & \yyy{\vdots} \\
        \chap{a_{m,1}} & \chap{a_{m,2}} & \chap{\cdots} & \chap{a_{m,n}} & \yyy{b_m}
        \end{bmatrix}
      \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      where the number of variables are equal to columns (\(n\)) of the matrix of coefficients and the numbers of equations are equal to the rows (\(m\)).
      \item Though, if you count the vector of constants as part of the augmented matrix then technically it's \fff{false}, since the totals columns is \(\chap{n}+\yyy{1}\).
    \end{itemize}}
    
    \item \pts{2} An inconsistent system can be made consistent by performing a sequence of elementary row operations.
    
    \basec{\begin{itemize}
      \item \false{False}: an inconsistent system is always inconsistent. For example, nothing can be down to the following matrix that would make it consistent:
      \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      \begin{bmatrix}[cccc|c]
        1 & -2 & 1 & -4 & 1 \\
        0 & 5 & 6 & 6 & 1 \\
        \rrr{0} & \rrr{0} & \rrr{0} & \rrr{0} & \rrr{6}
      \end{bmatrix}
      \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      One might try to say that multiplying the final row by 
      zero would make it consistent, but such multiplication would not be reversible, making it an invalid elementary row operation.
    \end{itemize}}
    
    \item \pts{2} A consistent system whose augmented matrix has 3 rows and 5 columns will have infinitely many solutions.
    
    \basec{\begin{itemize}
      \item \true{True}: a consistent system will have infinitely many solutions if the rank of the matrix is less than the number of columns.
      \item The max rank of matrix can be defined as a non-negative integer, including zero (\(\mathbb{N}_0\)), that is equal to the smaller of the two dimensions, either the \xxx{rows} or \yyy{columns}, i.e.,
      \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      \max(r) = r \in \mathbb{N}_0~\,|~\,0 \leq r \leq \min(\xxx{m},\yyy{n})
      \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      Thus, a \(3\times5\) matrix is rank deficient (\(r=3\)), meaning \(r<\yyy{n}\), which means that there are infinitely many solutions.
    \end{itemize}}

  Does the rank matter here actually? I have not explored linear transformations much, so I'm exploring things here. Hmm, let's create a rank deficient matrix and apply the transformation.
  \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{bmatrix}[ccc|c]
    -5 & -4 & 1 \\
    3 & 2 & -1  \\
    3 & 2 & -1  
  \end{bmatrix} 
  \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ -3 \end{bmatrix}
  \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  This results in infinite solutions:
  \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \operatorname{rref}\left(\begin{bmatrix}[ccc|c]
    -5 & -4 & 1 \\
    3 & 2 & -1  \\
    3 & 2 & -1  
  \end{bmatrix}\right)
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}[ccc|c]
    1 & 0 & -1 & 3 \\
    0 & 1 & 1 & -3 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0

  \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix} = 
  \begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ 3 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + r
  \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
  \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  So \bm{x} maps \(\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\) in this case, hmm\dots maybe I'm getting at nothing here.
