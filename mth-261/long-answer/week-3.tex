  \item Consider the matrix below to be the augmented matrix of a system of linear equation
  \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{bmatrix}[ccc|c]
  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
  5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
  9 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
  3 & 4 & 5 & 6
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Write the associated system of linear equations.
    \basec{\[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{cases}
    1x_1+2x_2+3x_3 = 4 \\
    5x_1+6x_2+7x_3 = 8 \\
    9x_1+0x_2+1x_3 = 2 \\
    3x_1+4x_2+5x_3 = 6 
    \end{cases}

    \item Define matrix \tbm{A} and vectors \tbm{x} and \tbm{b} so that the system of equations above can be represented as \(\bm{Ax}=\bm{b}\) 
    \basec{\[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \bm{A}=\begin{bmatrix}

    \bm{b}=\begin{bmatrix}
    4 \\ 8 \\ 2 \\ 6 
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item Define vectors \tbm{a_1}, \tbm{a_2}, and \tbm{a_3} and then write the above system as a single vector equation.
    \basec{\[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \bm{a_1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1x_1 \\ 5x_1 \\ 9x_1 \\ 3x_1 \end{bmatrix}\quad
    \bm{a_2} = \begin{bmatrix} 2x_2 \\ 6x_2 \\ 0x_2 \\ 4x_2 \end{bmatrix}\quad
    \bm{a_3} = \begin{bmatrix} 3x_3 \\ 4x_3 \\ 5x_3 \\ 6x_3 \end{bmatrix}

    \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \emph{\bm{a_1} + \bm{a_2} + \bm{a_3} = \bm{b}}

  \item Parametrize the solution set (write the general solution) to the equation \(x+2y+3z=5\) as a linear combination of vectors.
  \basec{\[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
