\section{Projections}\label{Projections}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \jjj{Projection}: an idempotent linear transformation \(P\) from a vector space to itself that results in the original transformation, i.e., 
  \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  P : V \to V ~|~ P^2 = P
  \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \jjj{Idempotent}: a property of certain operations whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the results.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \jjj{Orthogonal projection}: a projection on \(V\), when \(V\) is a Hilbert space, that satisfies:
  \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \langle P \bm{x}, \bm{y} \rangle = 
  \langle P \bm{x}, P\bm{y} \rangle =
  \langle \bm{x}, P\bm{y} \rangle~\forall~\bm{x,y} \in V
  \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \jjj{Hilbert space}: a generalized notion of Euclidean space that extends methods from \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and \(\mathbb{R}^3\) to space with any finite or infinite number of dimensions.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item This means an \hyperref[Vector Length]{\ulink{orthogonal projection}}, with regard to vector space,  \(V\) has an \hyperref[The Dot Product]{\ulink{inner~product}} (denoted \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle \) here) and has enough limits in the space (i.e., it's complete) to allow the techniques of calculus and vector algebra to be used.
        \end{itemize}
      \item Essentially, an orthogonal projection finds a 
    \end{itemize}
  \item \jjj{Oblique projection}: A projection on a Hilbert space that is not orthogonal.
