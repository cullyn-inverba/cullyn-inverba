\section{Singular Value Decomposition Fundamentals}\label{Singular Value Decomposition Fundamentals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \dd{Singular value decomposition (SVD)}: an extension of \hyperref[Eigendecomposition]{\ulink{eigendecomposition}} to any \(\xxx{m} \times \yyy{n} \) matrix via polar decomposition.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \dd{Polar decomposition}: the factorization of a matrix \tbm{A} in the form \(\bm{A}=\bm{U}{\bm
      {P}}\), where \tbm{U} is a unitary matrix and \(\bm{{P}}\) is a positive-semidefinite \hyperref[Diagonal and Trace]{\ulink{Hermitian matrix}}, both square and the same size.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \dd{Unitary}: when a complex square matrix has a \hyperref[Conjugate Transpose]{\ulink{conjugate transpose}} \(\bm{A}^* \) that is also it's inverse, i.e.,
          \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
          \bm{U}^*\bm{U} = \bm{U}\bm{U}^* = \bm{I}
          \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
          \item The real analogue of a unitary matrix is an \hyperref[Orthogonal Matrices]{\ulink{orthogonal matrix}}.
        \end{itemize}
      \item The rest of the details regarding polar decomposition will not be covered, as it detracts from understanding of single value decomposition; for now we will only deal with real matrices.
      \item Other important notes before continuing:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Recall how \hyperref[Hadamard Multiplication]{\ulink{creating symmetric matrices}} is done, i.e.,
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \(\bm{\bbb{A^T}A}=\bm{\yyy{S_{n\times n}}}\) \quad and \quad \(\bm{A\rrr{A^T}} = \xxx{\bm{S}_{m \times m}}\)
        \end{itemize}
        \item And that the \hyperref[Column Space]{\ulink{column and row space}} of matrices multiplied with their transpose are the same the original matrix column/row space, i.e., 
        \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        \yyy{C}(\bm{A\rrr{A^T}}) = \yyy{C}(\bm{\xxx{S}}) = \yyy{C}(\bm{A}), \quad \xxx{R}(\bm{\bbb{A^T} A}) = \xxx{R}(\yyy{\bm{S}}) = \xxx{R}(\bm{A})
        \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      \end{itemize}
      \item Finally, the singular value decomposition in more detail:
      \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      \underbrace{\bm{A}}_{\xxx{m} \times \yyy{n}} = \bbb{\underbrace{\U}_{\xxx{m} \times \xxx{m}}} \underbrace{\S}_{\xxx{m} \times \yyy{n}} \rrr{\underbrace{\Vt}_{\yyy{n} \times \yyy{n}}}
      \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\U\)~--- the orthogonal basis for \yyy{column space} of \bm{A}.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Termed the \bbb{\textbf{left singular vectors}} as \(\bbb{\bm{U}^T}\bm{A = \S \Vt}\)
            \item In the form of eigenvalue equation \(\bbb{\bm{u}^T}\bm{A}=\ttt{\sigma} \xxx{\bm{v}^T}\).
          \end{itemize}
        \item \(\S\)~--- a diagonal matrix consisting of the \ttt{\textbf{singular values} \(\bm{\sigma}\)} of \bm{A}. 
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the \hyperref[Matrix Rank]{\ulink{rank}} of \tbm{A}.
          \end{itemize}
        \item \(\Vt\)~--- the orthogonal basis for \xxx{row space} of \bm{A}.
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Termed the \rrr{\textbf{right singular vectors}} as \(\bm{A}\rrr{\bm{V}} = \U \S\)
            \item In the form of eigenvalue equation \(\bm{A}\rrr{\bm{v}}= \yyy{\bm{u}} \ttt{\sigma}\)
          \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Computing SVD}\label{Computing SVD}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Assuming \tbm{A} is an \(\xxx{m} \times \yyy{n} \) matrix, then multiplying by the transpose yields two results that are the similar to eigendecomposition and dependent on the order of multiplication:
    \begin{align*}
      \bm{A} &= \U \S \Vt &&& \bm{A} &= \U \S \Vt \\
      \bm{\bbb{A^T}A} &= (\U\S\Vt)^T \U\S\Vt &&& \bm{A\rrr{A^T}} &=  \U\S\Vt (\U\S\Vt)^T \\
      \bm{\yyy{S}} &= \Vt^T\S^T\yyy{\bm{U}^T} \U\S\Vt &&& \bm{\xxx{S}} &=  \U\S\Vt \Vt^T\S^T\yyy{\bm{U}^T} \\
      \bm{\yyy{S}} &= \bm{\xxx{V}}\S^T\bm{I}\S\Vt &&& \bm{\xxx{S}} &=  \U\S\bm{I}\S^T\yyy{\bm{U}^T} \\
      \bm{\yyy{S}} &= \bm{\xxx{V}}\S^2\Vt &&& \bm{\xxx{S}} &=  \U\S^2\yyy{\bm{U}^T} \\
      &\downarrow &&& &\downarrow \\
      \bm{\yyy{S}} &= \str{\bm{Q}}\eigL \str{\bm{Q}^T} &&& \bm{\xxx{S}} &= \str{\bm{Q}}\eigL \str{\bm{Q}^T} \\
      \xxx{R}(\bm{\yyy{S}}) &= \str{\bm{Q}}\eigL \str{\bm{Q}^T} &&& \yyy{C}(\bm{\xxx{S}}) &= \str{\bm{Q}}\eigL \str{\bm{Q}^T} \\
      \xxx{R}(\bm{A}) &= \str{\bm{Q}}\eigL \str{\bm{Q}^T} &&& \yyy{C}(\bm{A}) &= \str{\bm{Q}}\eigL \str{\bm{Q}^T} \\
      &\downarrow &&& &\downarrow \\ 
      \xxx{R}(\bm{A}) &= \bm{\xxx{V}}\S^2\Vt &&& \yyy{C}(\bm{A}) &=  \U\S^2\yyy{\bm{U}^T} 
    \end{align*}
    \item Thus, in the case of a real square matrix, \(\S^2 = \eigL\) when \tbm{A} is transposed with itself and \(\Vt\)/~\(\U\) act as the orthogonal basis for the \xxx{row}/\yyy{column} spaces, respectively.
    \item Reviewing the singular value equation:
    \begin{align*}
      \bm{A} = &~\U \S \Vt \\ 
      \swarrow &\hspace{14pt} \searrow \\
      \bbb{\bm{U^T}}\bm{A} = \S \Vt \hspace{20pt}&\hspace{35pt}\bm{A}\rrr{\bm{V}} = \U \S  \\
      \xxx{\bm{u}^T}\bm{A}=\ttt{\sigma} \xxx{\bm{v}^T} \hspace{24pt}&\hspace{37pt} \bm{A}\yyy{\bm{v}}= \yyy{\bm{u}} \ttt{\sigma}  
    \end{align*}
    \item I.e.,  the \bbb{left singular matrix \(\bm{U}^T\)} is a matrix whose \xxx{rows} describe a transformation of \(\bm{A} \to\) an \xxx{orthogonal basis \(\bm{V^T}\)} wherein each column scaled by its respective \ttt{singular value \(\sigma \)} describes the \xxx{row space} of \tbm{A}.
    \item Likewise, the \rrr{right singular matrix \(\bm{V}\)} is a matrix whose \yyy{columns} describe a transformation of \(\bm{A} \to\) an \yyy{orthogonal basis \(\bm{U}\)} wherein each column scaled by its respective \ttt{singular value \(\sigma \)} describes the \yyy{column space} of \tbm{A}.   
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Singular Values vs. Eigenvalues}\label{Singular Values vs. Eigenvalues}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \(\operatorname{eig}(\bm{A}^T \bm{A}) = \operatorname{svd}(\bm{A})^2 \)
    \item \(\operatorname{eig}(\bm{A}^T \bm{A}) = \operatorname{svd}(\bm{A}^T \bm{A}) \), as \(\operatorname{svd}(\bm{A}^T \bm{A})\) essentially squares the singular values.
    \item \(\operatorname{eig}(\bm{A})~\text{and}~\operatorname{svd}(\bm{A}) \) are usually not related at all, unless \tbm{A} consists all real entries.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Singular values are always real, whereas eigenvalues are likely to be complex.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  

  \subsection{Relation to Matrix Subspaces}\label{SVD Relation to Subspaces}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Since the SVD provides orthogonal basis for the row and column spaces of a matrix, then it also tells provides the \hyperref[Null Space]{\ulink{kernel and cokernel}} of the matrix.
    \item Again, revisiting the singular value equation and taking note of dimensions of each of the matrices yields plenty of useful information:
    \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \underbrace{\bm{A}}_{\xxx{m} \times \yyy{n}} = \underbrace{\U}_{\xxx{m} \times \xxx{m}} \underbrace{\S}_{\xxx{m} \times \yyy{n}} \underbrace{\Vt}_{\yyy{n} \times \yyy{n}}
    \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Again, the \emph{rank \(r\)} is equal to the sum of singular values greater than 0, i.e.,
      \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      \rank{\bm{A}=\Sigma~(\s > 0)}
      \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      \item Where the orthogonal basis \U~spanning all of \(R^{\xxx{m}}\) with:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item a \yyy{column space} of \yyy{\(1:\emph{r}\)}
          \item and a \xxx{cokernel} of \xxx{\(\emph{r}+1:\xxx{m}\)}
        \end{itemize}
      \item Likewise, the orthogonal basis \(\Vt\) spanning all of \(R^\yyy{n}\) has:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item a \xxx{row space} of \xxx{\(1:\emph{r}\)}
        \item and a \yyy{kernel} of \yyy{\(\emph{r}+1:n\)}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
