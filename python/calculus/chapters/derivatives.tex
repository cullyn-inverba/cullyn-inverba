\begin{itemize}
  \item \ddd{Derivative}: the measure of \emph{sensitivity to change} of the function \yyy{value} with respect to some change in its in \xxx{argument}.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Often described as the \emph{instantaneous rate of change} of a single variable function, since it is the slope a tangent line at a particular point, when it exists. 
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \ddd{Tangent line}: the line through a pair of points on a curve \prn{secant line}, except the points are \emph{infinitely close}, thus, it's the rate of change at that ``instant''.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize} 
  \item Formally, a \emph{derivative} of the function \(f(x)\) with respect to the variable \(x\) is the function \(\fp\) whose value at \(x\) is 
  \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \fp(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
  \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Provided the limit exists.
    \item Let \(z = x + h\), then \(h = z-x \land h \to 0 \ifandif z\to x\); this leads to an equivalent definition of the derivative \prn{sometimes more convenient}:
    \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      \fp(x) = \lim_{z \to x} \frac{f(z)-f(x)}{z-x}
    \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%3
  \end{itemize}

  \item \ddd{Differentiation}: the process of finding a derivative; if \(\fp\) exists at a particular point, then \(f\) is said to be differentiable at that point. 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If \(\fp\) exists at every point, then \(f\) is said to be differentiable.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \ddd{Notation}: there are many ways to denote the derivative, I prefer Leibniz's, but other notations can be useful in various contexts; some common notations \prn{for \(y = f(x)\)}:
  \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \fp(x) = y' = \dot{y} = \dydx = \ddx f(x) = D(f)(x) = D_x f(x)
  \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
