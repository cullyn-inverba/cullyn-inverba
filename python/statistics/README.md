# Statistics

- Udemy course content done, notes from this course can be found [here](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosvagor/notes/master/prior/statistics.pdf).
- Future classes and other content related to statistics will be integrated into this course, however, I predict no new updates for at least ~6 months.

## Resources

- [**Statistics** for Machine Learning w/ code by **Mike X Cohen**](https://www.udemy.com/course/statsml_x/)
  - [Exercises from the course](/python/statistics/exercises)
