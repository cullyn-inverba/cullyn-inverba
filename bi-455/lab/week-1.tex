\section{Background}\label{Background}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \jjj{Describe the steps in tissue preparation for microscopy:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \jjj{Fixation}: typically the first step in the preparation of histological sections in where tissues samples are treated with fixatives as a means to preserve and protect from biological decay.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \jjj{Fixatives}: solutions, compounds, or others means meant to either disable degradative enzymes, induce cross-linking (stabilizing proteins), or protect from extrinsic damage.
        \end{itemize}
      \item \jjj{Embedding}: the process of placing tissues in a harder medium (e.g., paraffin and plastic resins) as a means to allow for thin slicing of tissue.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Embedding occurs later in the process of preparation; once a tissue is fixed it must first undergo a series of steps:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \jjj{Dehydration}: the removal of water using ethanol.
            \item \jjj{Clearing}: replacement of an organic solvent miscible with both alcohol and the embedding medium, giving a translucent appearance.
            \item \jjj{Infiltration}: evaporation of the clearing solvent via exposure to heat (50--\SI{60}{\celsius}) promoting the final embedding of tissue into the medium.
          \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
      \item \jjj{Staining}: used as a means to increase contrast in tissue or specific features of tissue that are of interest as most biology tissue has very little inherent contrast.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \bbb{Basophilic}: dyes that have an affinity for \bbb{anionic} (net \bbb{negative} charge) cells parts.
            \begin{itemize}
              \item E.g., hematoxylin, toluidine blue, alcian blue, and methylene blue.
            \end{itemize}
          \item \rrr{Acidophilic}: dyes that have an affinity for \rrr{cationic} (net \rrr{positive} charge) cell parts.
            \begin{itemize}
              \item E.g., eosin, orange G, and acid fuchsin
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item \jjj{What does H \& E Stain?}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \chap{Hematoxylin (H)} and \amp{eonsin (E)} stains are among the most commonly used stains. 
        \begin{itemize}
          \item As mentioned above, hematoxylin acts as a \bbb{basophilic dye}, turning negatively charge organelles like the cell nucleus, RNA-rich regions of cytoplasm, cartilage, anywhere from \bbb{blue} \chap{\to} \xxx{purple}.
          \item Eosin acts as an \rrr{Acidophilic dye}, typically turning \amp{cationic structures pink}; sometimes it is considered to be a \jjj{counterstain}, i.e., typically a secondary dye that is meant to distinguish features.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item \jjj{What does PAS Stain?}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \xxx{Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)} utilizes hexose rings of polysaccharides and other carbohydrate rich structures to stain macromolecules \xxx{purple} \to~\fff{magenta}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \jjj{Describe Enzyme Histochemistry.}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Enzyme histochemistry is a method for localizing cellular structures using specific enzymatic activity in such structures.
      \item Preservation of enzymes often requires non-fixed or mildly fixed tissue and generally adhere to the following steps:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Tissues sections are immersed in solution containing the substrate of the enzyme to be localized.
          \item The enzyme is exposed to and allowed to act on the substrate.
          \item A marker compound is introduced and reacted with the product from step 2.
          \item Location is determined via precipitation of the insoluble product, which must be visible a light or electron microscopy, over the site of the enzyme.
        \end{enumerate}
      \item Phosphatase, dehydrogenase, and peroxidase are common examples of enzymes detected with histochemistry.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \jjj{How does Immunohistochemistry work?}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Immunohistochemistry (IHC): the use of labeled antibodies and antigens to identify and localize many proteins and macromolecules that lack specific enzymatic activity. 
      \item Visualization of such interactions are commonly  accomplished with either:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Chromogenic immunohistochemistry (CIH): use of antibodies conjugated to an enzyme that catalzyes a color-producing reaction.
          \item Immunofluorescence: tagging of a fluorophore (fluorescein, rhodamine) to an antibody. 
        \end{itemize}
      \item Common used in diagnosis of abnormal cells such as those in cancerous tumors. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
