    <h5><em>How can we create accessible learning environments?</em></h5>
    <p>I think the best way to create accessible learning environments has to mainly with how we measure progress. This goal of &ldquo;Ensuring Fair Assessment&rdquo; is the main strategies Rusul outlines in the article, <em>Equity for English-Language Learners</em>.</p>
    <p>Rusul elaborate on this goal with suggestions to provide students (particularly those with a language barrier) with instruction and resources they need that native-speakers might not. Tips include: extra time, essential literary resources, alternate methods of teaching, and access to translations. These are great tips to combat inequities in our current system, but fundamentally, if the method of assessment remains the same, then I suspect little progress will actually be made.</p>
    <h5><em>How can we as educators be adaptable in learning environments?</em></h5>
    <p>I think the article, <em>How to Receive Feedback with Grace and Dignity</em> and Joy Mayer's TED Talk both describe the best (probably) tool for adaptability to changing learning environments. The ability to react and respond to new conditions is literally the definition of adaptability, vital to being an educator, and even more vital when factoring in the unique learning environments with those of disabilities.</p>
    <p>We are going to do things wrong, and listening/being open to feedback is, what I think, the best way to correct and improve the learning environments we are all a part of.</p>
    <h5><em>What are some strategies from the assigned materials, and how can you incorporate them into your educational activities?</em></h5>
    <p>Allison's article, <em>Lesson Planning with Universal Design for Learning,</em> is definitely easily applicable towards our activities. Having a clear focus on goals and accounting for guaranteed variability in students, environments, and barriers is definitely something to keep in mind.</p>
    <p>That being said, I think the main goal of mine is the passing on of the lesson my high school biology teacher taught me. For years, I was a pseudo-class clown. I wasn't the funniest kid in class, but I had a strong aversion to authority, which expressed itself via constant (sometimes comical) questioning of authority and validity of what my teachers were saying. Most teachers&hellip; did not like this.</p>
    <p>However, my biology teacher LOVED this. For the first time, I was encouraged to ask questions. This marked the beginning of my realization of the power of leading with questions, and how one can speak so little, yet so say much with the right question.</p>
    <p>Thus, my goal involves an attempt to cultivate the curiosity that is often suppressed in institutionalized classrooms. Curiosity and questions increases variability and difficult to handle, which is why I think it's not traditionally emphasized. I think an intense level of intention to what the kids are saying, feeling, and how they're reacting to the activity is essential, with plans to immediately change to something more fun, or just different, if need be.</p>
