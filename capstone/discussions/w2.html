    <h2>Week 2: What is Ecological Education?</h2>

    <p>My understanding of the definition of ecological education centers around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_education">environmental education</a>. This definition centers the multi-disciplinary field of life sciences, e.g., biology, chemistry, physics, ecology, geology, mathematics, geography, etc. However, the exposure to the content of this course, and in particular this week's readings, is giving me the impression that the definition implied here is incorporation of relativism and spiritualism back into the sciences.</p>

    <p>If you are wondering that my statement "back into the sciences" has deeper implications, then you are correct. The conflict between relativism and rationalism goes back centuries, and the departure from relativism is rather recent, marking the transition to modernity, i.e., the enlightenment.</p>

    <p>This is a dense topic, occupying entire cultures and life work of many people. In no way am I going to attempt to give a background here. Instead, I'll use the prompts and readings throughout this course to illustrate common points of disagreement and discussion.</p>

    <p>To be clear, going forward I'll be defining the following words as:
      <ul>
        <li><strong> Environmental education</strong>: <ul><li>rationalism, theoretical, science, modernity</li></ul></li>
        <li><strong> Ecological education</strong>:
          <ul><li>environmental education + relativism, spiritualism, postmodernity</li></ul> </li>
        <li><strong> Indigenous education</strong>: </li>
        <ul><li> (ecological education - environmental education) + dualism, myth. </li></ul>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <h4><em>What distinguishes ecological and Indigenous education from traditional education?</em></h4>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I partially answered this in my initial response, directly above. Ironically, I define traditional education as being closer to indigenous education, as indigenous culture represents culture in a more evolutionary sense, akin to how humans existed for thousands of years in more tribal, nomadic like states. </p>
    
    <p>However, I believe traditional here is with reference frame of our lifetime, meaning traditional is more akin to the classroom settings we find ourselves in now. My definitions are essentially inverted of those of Cajete from <cite >American Indian Epistemologies</cite>, with the additional distinction of rationalism.</p>
      
    <p>To reiterate, the departure from relativism marks part of the transition towards the adoption of rationalism and modernity as we know it today, as relativism finds its home in tribal, religious, cultural traditions based on belief, faith, and personal experience.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <h4><em>Why do we need ecological and Indigenous education?</em></h4>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Loaded question. "Why we need" implies we do need it. Not to say we don't need it, just pointing out the implicit conclusion of the question. </p>
      
    <p>I don't think we "need" religious, indigenous, or faith based (relativistic) education. It is, however, very useful&mdash;there are truths and wisdom baked into religions, myths, and ancient tradition.</p>
    
    <p>Such studies can certainly be useful, they can derive insight, creativity, and perspectives that one might be blind too. However, in the quest for truth, only refutable claims have a place in the discussion. Faith, relativism, etc., remains uncritizable; you are free to believe what you want. </p>

    <blockquote>
      <h4><em>What do these types of education hope to create/achieve in the world, and how?</em></h4>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I think this is partially answered via the landmarks described by Cajete on pages 70 and 71 of the PDF. There's more too it, certainly; rather than attempt to describe it, I think will try to summarize it in a more brief, tangential sense. </p>

    <p>The transcendental domain (the complexity of nature and reality) is the invisible network of agency above the individual and its environment. Modernism has split it between nature and state, and turned nature into a resource. Postmodernism rejects transcendence (moving towards understanding the complexity of reality) altogether. Instead, postmodernism lives in the stores rewritten in every generation, while modernism attempts to transcend them and write new, more accurate stories that are closer to the truth.</p>

    <h4>What is education for? (Orr)</h4>
    <p>Orr's essay is closer to the environmental education definition I used. However, I don't think the claims it makes, while interesting, accurately represents the definition I am using.</p>

    <p>Well, that's not exactly true, what is being argued are the principles of education from top-down level. Really, the purpose of education is to seek truth at the most fundamental level. How we go about doing that is science, but even the methods of science are fractured itself, as it should be.</p>
      
   <p>Orr seems not to be talking about education, but the purpose of knowledge acquisition. These are related, but district topics. I am not certain of this conclusion, though, as my reading of his essay was more brief than I'd like to admit.</p>

    <h4>The Sound of Silverbells (Braiding Sweetgrass)</h4>

    <blockquote><em>"I asked them to invent a hypothesis or two to explain why the striking pattern existed."</blockquote></em>

    Funny, this was my exact idea for our group activity for Tyron park. This exercise was something a teacher once asked me once me to do; it made a lasting impression, and is one that I love to reciprocate to any curious mind. 

    <blockquote><em>As an enthusiastic young PhD, colonized by the arrogance of science, I had been fooling myself that I was the only teacher.</blockquote></em>

    I suspect the arrogance of science was a major theme of this chapter, with the conclusion revolving around,

    <blockquote><em>The land is the real teacher. All we need as students is mindfulness. Paying attention is a form of reciprocity with the living world, receiving the gifts with open eyes and open heart.</blockquote></em>

    <p>I think this is noble, basically the realization of ignorance and the arrogance it fosters. Although, I think attributing arrogance to science is mistaken. </p>
    
    <p>It's true, the culture of science itself can foster arrogance and some false authority, but this is not real science&mdash;it's pseudoscience, where the aim to prove things to be true, a natural tendency of humans. Good science is rejecting false claims and always seeking better ones; this philosophy of science is lost, even among many graduate and professional students.</p>
      
    <p>I support the observation that ecology (environmentalism) is an excellent route to discovering one's inherent ignorance. The arrogance arrives due to the meta-ignorance of the ever-increasing ignorance itself, i.e., the ignorance to the observation that the more you know, then the know that you don't know. Ideally, one must not fall under the illusion of breaking out of the cycle. This is the value in humility, which opposes arrogance.  </p>
