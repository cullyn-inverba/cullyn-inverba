      <em><q>What are some of your general values and philosophies? What are your educational values and philosophies?</q></em>
    </h5>
    <p>Tough question, almost too general to give a relevant answer. If I had to say, then I suppose <strong>openness</strong>, <strong>humility</strong>, and <strong>curiosity</strong> would have to be up there in the most general sense.</p>
    <p>Educationally speaking, I'd say that a <a rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">Socratic pedagogy</a> integrated with <a rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_rationalism">critical rationalism</a> would be a good definition of a starting point. Essentially, a focus on finding better approximations of the truth via the use of questions that highlight problems with current explanations and stimulate critical thinking.</p>
    <h5>
      <em><q>Why is it important that our educational practices reflect our values?</q></em>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Again, not the best way to ask a question. <q><em>Why is it important</em></q> implies the following proposition is important.
    </p>
    <p>Unlike last week's similarly phrased question, here I actually disagree. I don't think it's important&mdash;I think causality is reversed&mdash;i.e., I think our values should reflect our educational practices. How we teach is much easier to change; our values, not so easy.</p>
    <p>I think it is safe to assume that our values easily get baked-in to how we perceive ourselves and our place in society, which often make such values extremely hard to change. However, our educational practices should be constantly evolving by adjusting to new findings about how we learn and by testing how the findings suggest we ought to learn.</p>
    <p>Thus, if our values reflect or education practices, then this ever-evolving process will lead to easier adjustments to values. This is a stark contrast with constructivism, which correctly identifies problems, but due to the reversed conclusion discussed here, mostly leads to immutable values that blindly lead communities towards extremely biased solutions and an inability to adapt to change.</p>
    <h5>
      <em><q>What are some ways that you might enact your values and philosophies in your educational practice?</q></em>
    </h5>
    <p>This question demonstrates the danger of assuming that educational practices should reflect or values. If you allow yourself to project your values onto educational practices, then your values will heavily skew the ability to adapt to changing learning environments, as your values will constantly reinforce subpar educational practices.</p>
    <p>To be clear, this conclusion relies on the assumption that our values are mostly adopted via <a rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">memes</a>, whose main vector of transmission is education. I think it is possible that values could change overtime without education, even if it may be difficult. The issue is that if values influence education, then education will only serve to reinforce those values, even if they are wrong, rather than discover better values.</p>
    <p>The only superior method to education, that I know of, is the use of violence and oppression. Censorship of the new/emerging values, use of lies and deception (intentional or not) via spreading of false information, extreme physical violence, or even the use of influence as violence as seen in modern cancel culture, are all very effective means of forcing people to adopt your values.</p>
    <p>With this understanding, I'd argue enacting values into educational practices is violence. Using your influence/power to indoctrinate the new minds to your way of thinking is abusing the inherent ignorance of the receiver. Sadly, I will admit, this isn't so easy to solve as it's nearly impossible to separate use of one's educational practices from one's values.</p>
    <p>
      This problem of attempting to separate one's self from the practice is the driving force behind the aversion of teaching who we are that Palmer argued against. His argument? <q><em>It's not real, it's just not the way life happens (3:01)</em></q> Certainly an interesting objective claim on the world from someone who rejects objectivism.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I think Palmer really means is that, in practice (reality), it's so difficult to separate one's self that any attempt to do so leads to a <q><em>deformed teacher and learning, unreal teaching and learning (3:07)</em></q
      >. This I have to agree, it is very hard and without the values it can lead to deformed representations&mdash;in some subjects.
    </p>
    <p>The best (not only) counter example to invalidate his claim is mathematics. Mathematics doesn't give a shit what you think, feel, or value. Even if you wiped out ever human being and started from scratch again, the same fundamental laws would be found (albeit, formulated differently), and this is independent of any values adopted along the way. Values would only serve to speed or slow the process.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Ah, my post is getting too long again. However, this is a result of being nuanced, examining alternative explanations. It takes up time, space, and work. That's another factor that makes it so hard to remove yourself, your experience, your values, from the arguments/propositions you make and teach.</p>
    <p>In practice, it's difficult to separate one's values. Thus, given current understandings, the best value to enact would have to be the continual effort to value truth over belief, which means constantly seeking out how you are wrong, rather than how you are right. Any other values that aid in that self correction and allow for new values to emerge would, by definition, be excluded from the danger of reinforcing previously held values, as such values themselves claim to be refutable.</p>

    <h4>We Teach Who We Are (Palmer)</h4>
    <p>Included in response to prompts</p>
    <h4>Teaching for Transformation (Burns)</h4>
    <p>Okay, first, a huge red flag. There are 209 matches for the word <q>sustain</q>, 31 for <q>sustainable</q>, and as far as I can tell, no real definition of what is meant by sustainable.</p>
    <p>Now, this isn't the end of the world. I'm sure no there was no intentional malice on Burn's part, but it's a huge problem. Sustainability is reading buzzword status, which means there are probably hundreds of alternative definitions of the word. And I get it, it should be simple, like knowing what respect is, right? Wrong, both words are notoriously hard to pin down.</p>
    <p>Well, the issue is that both sustainability and ecological education have been hijacked here. Both words are extremely positive, and something no reasonable person would argue against, but almost no where in the paper are principles of environmental education, ecology, or even basic biology introduced. It's poor writing, but I guess not surprising to see from the <em>Journal of Sustainability</em></p>
    <p>And okay, maybe an article of such journal has no need for a basic definition. But wow, it's such a gross feeling to me. This paper feels like nothing more than sneaking in constructivism under the guise of biological terms that one would argue against. Shame. Even if there are legitimate arguments, I would argue that it severally calls into question any claims Burns makes to the point where this paper becomes a poor starting point for any conversation.</p>
    <h4>Allegiance to Gratitude (Braiding Sweetgrass)</h4>
    <p>Okay, I'll keep this one short.</p>
    <p>
      <q><em>And it&rsquo;s not exactly liberty if they force you to say it, is it? (pg 108)</em></q> <br /><br /><q><em>Aha! Now we see the violence inherent in the system! (Monty Python and the Holy Grail)</em></q>
    </p>
    <p>Illustration of the problem of enacting values in educational systems. I stopped participating in the pledge at an early age as well. To me, nationalism is an atrocious value. It encourages conquering and colonization, promotes selfishness, exclusion, inequality, violence, superiority, and gives the successful a belief that their moral desert is justified.</p>
    <p>I want to live in a world where we are welcome, united, borderless. One where we are thankful for everyone and everything. I welcome gratitude.</p>
