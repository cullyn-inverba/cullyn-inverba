    <h5><em>How has knowledge been defined in dominant society, and thus dominant educational systems?</em></h5>
    <p>Data, information, knowledge, understanding, wisdom&hellip; these are all words that get clumped together and often assumed to be synonymous. Most often, the discussion about knowledge and it's relation to intellect, education, success, etc., are really arguments over just mismatched definitions to these words and the assumptions they make.</p>
    <p>The readings this week presents nothing new, instead they are mostly just rehashing of century old debates between relativism vs. rationalism, where relativism is instead presented as indigenous worldviews. This lens can be useful to make finer distinction useful for disagreement over various points, but ultimately I'd say it's just taking advantage of the fallacy of &ldquo;natural = better&rdquo; in order to support relativism, whether that's explicit or not.</p>
    <p><em>Understanding the Crisis in American Education (D. Wildcat)</em> claims that <em>&ldquo;what counts as knowledge in mainstream education is too often short-term memorization of facts.&rdquo;</em> This is an extremely basic view of what knowledge is; it's true this is what we'd call descriptive knowledge, but this is only a small fraction of what knowledge actually is.</p>
    <p>That being said, there are many classrooms that use this memorization of facts as the only measure of progress, and well, what measure we measure governs much of our actions. If what we measure has such a great effect, then we ought to introduce more information and valued metrics if we are to move away from the overemphasis of descriptive knowledge.</p>
    <h5><em>What are some strategies to create learning environments that account for varied knowledge and parts of ourselves besides the intellect?</em></h5>
    <p>I'm not exactly sure what &ldquo;besides the intellect&rdquo; is referring to here, but I assume it's the misunderstanding of &ldquo;objective truth&rdquo; that &ldquo;varied knowledge&rdquo; (relativism) rallies against.</p>
    <p>I think the confusion surrounds misunderstanding of what science is. Wildcat states,</p>
    <blockquote><em>"In fact, I would suggest that there is knowledge contained in these cultural practices that modern science cannot acquire using a mechanistic and dissective approach, especially when the West&shy;ern idea of universal objective truth reduces itself to abstract mathematical formulas."</em></blockquote>
    <p>Wildcat is equating science and objective truth with reductionism, which is how science first departed from religious and relativistic thought, but in no way is what defines objective truth. Anyway, I'll stop myself from going deeper into this misunderstanding.</p>
    <p>For now, I'd say accounting for various experience is still a very useful strategy, but what I am saying is it does not oppose objective truths. Varied experience instead should be thought as the ultimate source that cultural evolution uses to generate various knowledge, much like how mutations in DNA is the ultimate source that biological evolution uses to generate various proteins. However, neither represent finals forms&mdash;collections of knowledge leads to understanding and wisdom, much like collections of proteins lead to cells and organisms.</p>
    <h5><em>Which of these strategies might you employ in your educational activities for this course?</em></h5>
    <p>I think the most important from these reading in terms of application towards our educational activities comes from Tyler DeWitt and his TED talk <em>Hey science teachers&mdash;make it fun!</em> I think Tyler clearly outlined the aversion many feel towards science. Science is all about finding better and better explanations, but it's super hard to remember what it's like not to know something.</p>
    <p>Therefore, when you teach kids you have to pull back, start from poor explanations that are easier (more fun) to understand, then build up again. This rebuilding of knowledge is where relativistic experiences are the most valuable. The varied starting points are the building blocks that can lead to alternative and better explanations that might be unknowingly lost due to implicit assumptions of the current explanations.</p>
    <h5><em>Why is it important to create holistic learning environments?</em></h5>
    <p>Holistic learning environments, geez, that's a messy term. Again&hellip; is it important? Not a productive question.</p>
    <p>Instead of answering this messy question, I instead will just comment on the article, <em>Maslow's Hierarchy Connect to Blackfoot Beliefs</em>. First, there has been much critical of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. The only real insight from Maslow's work is that, fundamentally, safety and physiological needs must be met before any other need. All other needs will break down in the absence, even under the first nation perspective that Karen describes, or any of the other hundreds of alterations on the hierarchy.</p>
    <p>The formulations of needs is more dependent on the cultural that constructs them. The First Nation's perspective that Karen outlines is a closer representation of the needs of collective societies, rather than Maslow's, which is a closer representation of individualistic societies.</p>
    <p>I suppose the key takeaway here is to be mindful that what appears to be basic needs, even if they are outlined in an easy to digest diagram, are just approximations to values in the culture wherein they were defined. Any starting place can be built upon to derive moral obligations of the culture.</p>
