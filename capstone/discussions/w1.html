    <h1>Prompt</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>Introduce yourself. Share your name, pronouns, major, where you're from, where you live, and your favorite place to be outside.</li>
      <li>Drawing on the readings, briefly answer the guiding questions for the week:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>What is your relationship to land?</li>
        <li>How has your relationship with land been shaped by dominant cultural/societal systems?</li>
        <li>How has your relationship with land been shaped by your educational experiences?</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Cullyn (&ldquo;Kuh-lin&rdquo;). I don't really know what my pronouns are; I definitely support a gender-neutral social default, so I suppose they/them. However, declaring pronouns appears to me to be a social signal declaring support of standpoint epistemology, which I reject as it is approaching a fervent, dogmatic culture. This opposition of mine is not an ideological position, so I'm easily
      willing to change my mind if that's something you want to discuss with me.
    </p>
    <p>Anyways, back to the prompt: I consider myself to be from the Pacific Northwest, I've lived in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, New Mexico, and Utah, but the majority has now been Oregon, with Bend/Portland being &ldquo;home.&rdquo; I live in Portland now, on campus (Stephen Epler building at the moment).</p>
    <p>
      I have an affinity for high places with great views and water nearby, so hike with cliffs overlooking rivers/oceans would be among my favorite places. More specifically, for the past 2 summers I have been going to <a rel="noopener" href="https://goo.gl/maps/UycvB2dQtMD64doWA">Angel's Rest</a> (my <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1_Fsomhsvj/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">photo</a> is actually
      Google map's main photo as of now!) and I'd have to say that's my favorite place outside. I keep an eye out clear day with a new moon, take psychedelics, and spend the night under the stars. I absolutely love it.

    <h5>Witness to the Rain (Braiding Sweetgrass)</h5>
    <p>The pros of this book are beautiful, attention capturing, and wonderfully illustrative. Even just a few short paragraphs in and my vision faded into memories of past treks through many of Oregon's forests&mdash;it's astonishing what some words on a page can invoke inside ones mind, especially when the beholder shares the experience being described. The following passage really stuck out to me:</p>
    <blockquote>"If there is meaning in the past and in the imagined future, it is captured in the moment. When you have all the time in the world, you can spend it, not on going somewhere, but on being where you are. So I stretch out, close my eyes, and listen to the rain."</blockquote>
    <p>
      This was significant to me, not for the inherent message that implies the importance of appreciating the moment, but instead because of how common this realization occurs to one's self while in nature. The relationship between time and attention is, ironically, brought to your attention with such ease through experiences like the ones described in this chapter. I agree, one cannot help but close your eyes and
      listen, soaking and experiencing the moment, much like how the nature soaks and moves the water throughout the sprawling ecosystem.

    <h5>Trouble with Wilderness (Cronon)</h5>
    <blockquote>"If wildness can stop being (just) out there and start being (also) in here, if it can start being as humane as it is natural, then perhaps we can get on with the unending task of struggling to live rightly in the world&mdash;not just in the garden, not just in the wilderness, but in the home that encompasses them both."</blockquote>
    <p>What a solid way to end such an excellent paper! It's concise, elegant, and communicates an answer to a problem many feel like they have to face.</p>
    <p>To me, this paper is essentially arguing, and may have played a foundation role in establishing, one of the guiding principles of conservation biology&mdash;i.e., the realization of <strong>human presence.</strong></p>
    <p>
      Human presence must be included in conservation planing, for any efforts to wall off nature and safeguard it from humans will ultimately fail. This is due to the fact, that as this paper elegantly argues, that humans are also a part of nature, there is no distinction. Extending the importance of this realization further into conversation in general leads us to another realization, which is that a path to
      conservation in the long term is only viable if a reasonable standard of living for all people is achieved, as inequality and access to basic needs will surpass the desire to conserve the commons (nature) that we are all a part of.
    </p>
    <h5>Nature is everywhere (Ted Talk)</h5>
    <p>The Ted talk legitimately made me get emotional, I loved it. The talk is really an extension of the conclusions drawn from Cronon's paper. One thing I really liked about the video was the attention drawn to a peculiar practice of conservation biology that, while important, reinforces a common misunderstanding, probably due to misnomer of the word "conservation."</p>
    <p>
      Really, conservation isn't about stopping change or maintaining the <i>status quo</i>. Instead, conservation is about conserving the <b>right to change</b>. This distinction reveals why, ironically, people who might be labeled as "conservative" are against funding for conservation biology, as the "conservative" label is typically for those who want to maintain the <i>status quo</i>. Meanwhile, those who might
      be labeled "liberal" are for the freedom to change, thus are generally for funding of conservation biology.
    </p>
    <p>Beware, there is no good or evil side here. As we see, the change humans have inflicted upon the world is of too large of magnitude and direction. Thus, maintaining the <i>status quo</i> of national parks is a necessary task that carries an immense responsibility, as the natural rate of evolution would lead to the extinction and collapse of these vital ecosystems in the parks.</p>

    <h3>Dear Megan,</h3>
    <p><em>What you learned from the assigned materials and class activities for the week?</em></p>
    <p><strong>Nothing</strong>, really. Now now now, I know this question is emphasized is pedagogical circles surrounding constructivism, but this question really, really sucks.</p>
    <p>Well, why does it suck? Well, there is science and an art to asking questions. Good instruction, engaging dialogue, fruitful discussion, and meaningful knowledge acquisition really centers around one thing&mdash;<strong>questions.</strong></p>
    <p>It's much easier to answer <i>good questions</i>, then ask them. Conversely, it's much harder to answer <i>shallow questions</i>, then ask them.</p>
    <p>But wait, this isn't an insult, it's feedback. There is a kernel of truth, as being able to review and contextualize what you learned is a very important question. However, it's like asking, "What was your favorite part of your vacation?"</p>
    <p>Now, you definitely want to know the amazing parts of someone's vacation, but this is such a lazy way to do so. It places all the burden of contextualizing, recalling, and ranking of things on the one being asked. This is a lot of work, and unless the person is unusually practiced in story telling, then the answer you are most likely to get is... "the food!" Ahhhhhh&mdash;BORING!</p>
    <p>
      Similarly, asking what a lazy question like "what did you learn" is a lot to ask, as awareness of what you did not know at the time, what you learned, what you remember, how you learned, and the transition between the states is really only gained with hindsight and contextualization in future applications in a relevant domain. This means it is <em>very unlikely</em> that one will be able to articulate what one
      has learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, you are (most likely) going to get a minimal response, just good enough to satisfy the request of the inquirer. A good instructor is one who understands the subject deeply enough and remembers the experience of learning itself. They then are able to use said own expertise and experience to prod and ask the <i>right questions</i>, such that, they allow for the revisiting of the revelations and experiences
      of the one being asked in such a way that it almost feels impossible to not share.
