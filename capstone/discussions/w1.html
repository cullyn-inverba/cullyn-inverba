    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Cullyn (&ldquo;Kuh-lin&rdquo;). I don't really know what
      my pronouns are; I definitely support a gender-neutral social default, so
      I suppose they/them. However, declaring pronouns appears to me to be a
      social signal declaring support of standpoint epistemology, which I
      reject. This is not an ideological position, however, so I'm easily
      willing to change my mind if that's something you want to discuss with me.

      Anyways, back to the prompt: I consider myself to be from the Pacific
      Northwest, I've lived in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, New Mexico, and Utah,
      but the majority has now been Oregon, with Bend/Portland being
      &ldquo;home.&rdquo; I live in Portland now, on campus (Stephen Epler
      building at the moment).

      I have an affinity for high places with great views and water nearby, so
      hike with cliffs overlooking rivers/oceans would be among my favorite
      places. More specifically, for the past 2 summers I have been going to

      has is actually Google map's main photo as of now!) and I'd have to say
      that's my favorite place outside. I keep an eye out clear day with a new
      moon, take psychedelics, and spend the night under the stars. I absolutely
      love it.
