    <h5><em>What are some strategies to create inclusive and equitable learning environments identified in the readings?</em></h5>
    <p>Ashley DiFranza, in her article, <em>4 Practices to Promote Equity in the Classroom</em>, describes various techniques to promote equity and inclusive environments,</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Calling in</strong>: essentially calling attention to potentially destructive/non-inclusive ways of discussion that normally go unnoticed/ignored.</li>
      <li><strong>Classroom standards:</strong> here Ashley describes standards like embracing uncomfortable situations, respecting everyone voice, listening, and more. Essentially, this suggestion involves setting up some sort of baseline that establish how students expect the classroom to operate.</li>
      <li><strong>Setting the tone:</strong> seems to fall in the same line of classroom standards, but I think the distinction here is meant to promote the change of standards set in the previous step.</li>
      <li><strong>Analyzing class makeup</strong>: I'm not sure what Ashley is really saying here, besides be flexible and able to respond to class needs. This step appears to be a means to enhance inclusiveness of diverse backgrounds that may otherwise be lost in the first three steps.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><em>Why is it important to create these environments?</em></h5>
    <p>Again, this question implies that it is. Again, I don't think it's important. I disagree not on the basis for the conclusions drawn, but instead because I think it's classroom structure is pretty too broken to begin with.</p>
    <p>Getting into the difference is quite a journey, and I've been wasting far too much time on these discussion posts, so I'll reframe from that now. Instead, I'll note the important aspects that are still useful in the broken learning environments we find ourselves in now. Also, many of the following are just as useful for general life skills, so again, my disagreement here is not based on principle and what is being discussed can certainly be important.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Help for Kids the System Ignores</strong>: Victor does a great job in this talk enacting what appears to be related to "setting the tone" and "analyzing class makeup" by changing how we talk and perceive students that don't typically fit "normal" classroom settings. This framing is important, as the ill-conceived perceptions towards such students exclude them from education and community inclusion and need to change.</li>
      <li><strong>What Makes a Good Teacher Great</strong>: I love videos about teachers who share what they have learned, so valuable. Azul does a fantastic job demonstrating the importance of listening. I think there should be teachers, and students, who can proudly say they are focused on studying, teaching and understanding the skill of listening.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop Telling Kids to "Be Careful" and What to Say Instead</strong>: this article surprised me to be honest. The focus on fostering awareness and encouraging problem-solving for the individual is a great way to reframe fearful situations and empower learners. This attitude seems to run counter to the "safe space" narrative that runs strong in culturally dominant critical race theory, but perhaps this perception of "safe space" is due to associations with the word safe and its implicit assumption of needing comfort, leading to false conclusions to what a safe space is, rather than what it was meant to be (an uncomfortable place where taking risks is encouraged).</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><em>Which strategies might you employ in your educational activities for this course?</em></h5>
    <p>I think many of the attempted strategies, that while certain noble in intention, are actually doing more harm to achievement of the previously discussed education practices.</p>
    <p>For example, understanding the purpose behind your decision to speak and being aware of the space you take is absolutely vital and a super valuable skill everyone ought to have. However, I think this ideal is leaned on so heavily in many classrooms that it leads to no one wanting to take up any space and ends up in no meaningful discussions taking place.</p>
    <p>Most effort is instead directed towards monitoring equal outcomes of speakers, which causes everyone to b afraid of getting/taking too much attention. Which, ironically, only benefits those higher on the sociopathic spectrum who don't mind being the center of attention and will gladly step into the vacuum.</p>
    <p>Instead, I much prefer letting two to three individuals take up 80&ndash;90 percent of the discussion, with the other 10&ndash;20 percent of people contributing mostly through questions (the group I prefer to be in). A very inequitable outcome in terms of "taking up space", but one that is ultimately more engaging, beneficial, and equitable to all those who participate and even for those who do not say a word.</p>

    <h3>Potential Questions for Response Posts</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>How do <em>you</em> define (and measure?) equity?</li>
      <li>How do <em>you</em> define (and measure?) equality?</li>
      <li>
        Is there a relationship between equality of outcome and equality of opportunity?
        <ul>
          <li>If so, what type of relationship is it?</li>
          <li>If not, then how might we maximize both of them?</li>
          <li>If it's too complicated to answer, then how so?</li>
          <li>If you are not sure, then what's factors could the cause of the uncertainty?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
