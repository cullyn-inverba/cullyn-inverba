  \subsection{Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \ddd{Descriptive statistics}: the processes of using and analyzing summary statistics that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Methods/measures of descriptive statistics:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \hyperref[Subsection: Data Distributions]{\dlink{Distribution shape}}
            \item \hyperref[Subsection: Measures of Central Tendency]{\dlink{Mean, median, mode}}
            \item \hyperref[Subsection: Measures of Dispersion]{\dlink{Variance}}
            \item \hyperref[Subsection: Statistical Moments]{\dlink{Kurtosis, skew}}
          \end{itemize}
        \item No relation to population.
        \item No generalization to other data sets.
        \item Concerned only with properties of observed data.
      \end{itemize}
    \item \ddd{Inferential statistics}: the process data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Methods/measures of inferential statistics:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \hyperref[Chapter: Probability Theory]{\dlink{P-value}}
            \item \hyperref[Chapter: Hypothesis Testing]{\dlink{Hypothesis testing}}
            \item \hyperref[Chapter: T-Tests]{\dlink{T/F/\(\chi^2 \) value}}
            \item \hyperref[Chapter: Confidence Intervals]{\dlink{Confidence intervals}}
            \item And essentially all of applied statistics.
          \end{itemize}
        \item Assumes that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population. 
        \item Entire purpose is to generalize/relate features to other data sets.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Accuracy, Precision, Resolution}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \ddd{Accuracy}: the relationship between the measurement and the actual truth.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Inversely related to bias; colloquially interchangeable with accuracy. 
      \end{itemize}
    \item \ddd{Precision}: the certainty of each measurement.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Inversely related to \hyperref[Subsection: Measures of Dispersion]{\dlink{variance}}
      \end{itemize}
    \item \ddd{Resolution}: the number of data points per unit measurement (e.g., time, space, individual, etc).
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{Data Distributions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The shape of data distributions are functions of \hyperref[Chapter: Probability Theory]{\dlink{probability theory}}; a more in-depth explanation will be covered later, but for now coverage of common distribution types might be useful.
    \item There is one major distinction of distributions based on \hyperref[Subsection: Data Types]{\ulink{data types}}, either discrete or continuous.
    \item \ddd{Discrete distribution}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Deals with events that occur in countable sample spaces; contains finite number of outcomes.
        \item Summation of values can be done to estimate probability of an interval.
        \item Expressed with graphs, piece-wise functions, or tables.
        \item Expected values might not be achievable.
        \item Common examples:
        \begin{multicols}{2}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution}{Bernoulli}: a model for the set of possible outcomes of any single binary experiment.
          \item \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution}{Binomial}: a sequence of \(n\) independent Bernoulli experiments; a basis for the binomial test.
          \item \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution}{Uniform}: a known, finite number of values are equally likely to be observed.
          \item \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution}{Poisson}: a sequence of independent events over a specified interval with a known constant mean rate.
        \end{itemize}
        \end{multicols}
      \end{itemize}
      \item \ddd{Continuous distribution}: 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Deals with events that occur in a continuous sample space; contains infinitely many consecutive values. 
        \item Summation of values in order to determine probability of interval not possible; integrals used instead.
        \item Expressed with continuous functions or graphs.
        \item Common examples:
        \begin{multicols}{2}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution}{Normal}: used to represent real-valued random variables who are not known; very common.
            \item \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution}{Chi-Squared}: the sum of squares of \(k\) independent standard normal random variables.
            \item \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution}{Lognormal}: distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed.
            \item \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student\%27s_t-distribution}{Student's T}: estimations of the mean using mall sample sizes with unknown standard deviations.
          \end{itemize}
        \end{multicols}
      \end{itemize}

\section{Descriptive Techniques}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[]

  \subsection{Measures of Central Tendency}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \ddd{Mean \(\overline{x}\)}: the sum of all measurements \(x_i\) divided by the number \(n\) of observations in the data set \(x\), i.e.,
    \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \overline{x}= n ^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i
    \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Suitable for roughly normally distributed data of continuous data types.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \ddd{Median \(\operatorname{med}(x)\)}: the middle value of the data, i.e.,
    \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    x_i,\quad i=\frac{n+1}{2}
    \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Suitable for unimodal distributions of continuous data types.
      \item Odd number of observations with no distinct middle value are usually defined as the mean of the two middle values.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \ddd{Mode}: most common value.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Suitable for any discrete distribution, usually used for nominal data types.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Measures of Dispersion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \ddd{Dispersion}: the measure of how distributed, or deviated, data are around a central value.
    \item \ddd{Variance \(\sigma^2, s^2\)}: the primary measure of dispersion, or more explicitly, the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean, i.e.,
    \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_i-\overline{x})^2
    \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Suitable for any distribution; better for normally distributed data.
      \item Mean centering, i.e., \((x_i - \overline{x})\), is done to capture the dispersion around the average, but not the magnitude of the values themselves.
      \item The sum of a mean-centered data set would be zero, thus it is squared.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \ddd{Mean absolute difference (MAD)}: when the absolute value of mean-centered data is taken instead of the square value. 
          \item MAD is more robust to outliers, but further from Euclidean distance and less commonly used. 
        \end{itemize}
      \item Division by \(n-1\) is used for sample variance, as often sample sizes can be small and are considered empirical quantities; \(n ^{-1}\) is used for population variance (a theoretical quantity).
      \item \ddd{Standard Deviation \(\sigma\)}: simply the square root of variance, \(\sqrt{\sigma^2}\)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Statistical Moments}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{Visualizations Revisited}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \ddd{QQ plot}:
    \item \ddd{Histogram bin number \(k\)}:
    \item \ddd{Violin plot}:
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{itemize}
